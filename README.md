## Hi, I'm Praneet

I'm a Research Engineer @ Google DeepMind working on brining the benefits of AI to the world. Prior to this I was working on an exactly similar role @ Googl Cloud.

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/PraneetDutta/PraneetDutta.github.io/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
