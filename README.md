# Hi, I'm Praneet!

I'm a Research Engineer @ Google DeepMind working on bringing the benefits of AI to the world. Prior to this I was @ Google Cloud, working with organizations in leveraging Cloud AI for their industries.

My goal is to optimize the quality of human life making it sustainable for the long term future. Specifically, I'm interested in some of the broader challenges, opportunities of the 21st century. I'm working on and researching areas related to Climate Change, urban pollution monitorining, control, virtual reality moonshots. Through this, I volunteer as an AI advisor for non-profit's on how we can tackle real world problems through the latest scientific advancements. 

I enjoy the intersection of AI and art, and have been dabbling on using GAN's to generate themes of popular works in the field. 

In my free time, catch me learning the percussion, enjoying a game  of soccer/tennis, and hikes along the coast.
